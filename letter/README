Latex letter class for INRIA

Usage:
Use the provided file letter.tex as a model by filling in your data
(if you use accented letters, store the file as utf-8, not as latin-1).

The file compiles with pdflatex and xelatex.
With pdflatex, the standard latex fonts are used for the address in the footer.
With xelatex, install the provided fonts of the Exo family into the standard
font location of your system (for instance under GNU/Linux, by simply copying
them to /usr/local/share/fonts); these are used as a replacement for the
proprietary Neo Sans fonts.
