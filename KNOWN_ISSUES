There are several limitation while trying to copy the official INRIA theme.

Rationale: In this document we refers as official document the file "110616_inria_charte_identitaire.pdf".

The major issue is that the official document refers to the powerpoint template as specification (p.41).
This imply that there is no explicit specifications of sizes, etc..

# postscript
- the postscript version do not support transparency in figures.
  We need to find which parts misunderstand EPS 3.0.

# fonts
- We cannot use/have the fonts "univers" nor "Neo Sans". 
- The text sizes are bigger in beamer than in the template.

# Text/figures Positioning
- the official document do not really specify them.
  What is really difficult is to know if sizes are relative to papersize, to fontsize, or fixed.
- the powerpoint template do not follow the official positioning (based on the papersize).
  So we do not have a good reference there.

# colors
- the official document do not specify the RGB profile (if RGB refers to sRGB or Adobe RGB or else).
  Since it is convenient for us, we consider it refers sRGB.
- the official document do not specify the corresponding RGB values of CMYK colors on p.15.
  The software "gcolor2" seems to be able to convert them (it matches the conversions on p.14 colors).
  See also figures-inria/custom/colors-gradation.txt.

# Figures
- We had to "redo" several figures in order to have transparency. They are in "figures-inria/custom/"
- In the official document, fading should take 25% of the paper height, but it does seems take more 
  (yellowish color above the 25% line).

# framesubtitle
- the official document do not provide frame subtitle. So we invented one.

# table of contents
- it seems that beamer do not distinguish text color and enumeration color in toc.
  Thus it will be hard to use the red enumeration color in toc.
